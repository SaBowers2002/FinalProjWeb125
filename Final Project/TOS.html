        <h2>- Prices -</h2>
        <h3>----------</h3>
        <p>
            Prices vary depending on the complexity of the texture and the model it is done on:
            - Minimum prices will begin at $25
            - Recolors ONLY will be $15
            - More complex models / designs begin at $35 plus
            <br>
            <br>
            I do NOT upload models for people (unless otherwise stated)!
            I only sell re-textures for models and model assets!
            If you would like to talk to me about uploading for you, please note that it will add an additional fee to the original cost.

        <h2>- Payment -</h2>
        <h3>----------</h3>
        <p>
            ~ I accept the following forms of payment ~
            <br>
            - PayPal
            <br>
            - You can purchase a model of equal value or more from my wishlist located on my discord server
            (retexture for the requested model would be free afterwards unless price increases)
            <br>
            - You can provide an art trade if mutually agreed upon (I will need to see several examples of your work and like what you have to offer)
        </p>

        <h2>- Refunds -</h2>
        <h3>----------</h3>
        <p>If you would like to cancel a commission while it is still in process, you will receive HALF of the original price back.
            If I am unable to fulfill the commission myself you will receive a full refund.</p>

        <h2>- Work Flow -</h2>
        <h3>----------</h3>
        <p>
            I work on re-textures on my free time - and I'm a very busy person!
            While I always try to get avatars done as soon as possible, I have a full time job and I'm a college student. Due to this you can expect an average of 2-3 weeks turnaround.
            I aim to provide the best quality work that I can offer, and this allows me the time and space to deliver that promise.
            I will provide numerous WIP photos if requested throughout the process, and you are more than welcome to provide your own critiques and changes you would like me to make- however once we have both agreed on a finished product, I will NOT be continuing work on it unless you re-commission me.
            Project files will be deleted 3 weeks after they are finished. I am not responsible for broken files after the final product is delivered.
        </p>

        <h2>- Requirements -</h2>
        <h3>----------</h3>

        <p>
            References: References are helpful when creating re-textures.
            If possible, a drawing of the design from several angles would be preferable, but at the bare minimum I need a color palette and basic description of the design.
            If you are using a purchased design you must prove to me that you have the rights to the design via a screenshot of your receipt.
            Ownership of the model/asset being re-textured: You MUST prove purchase of anything that you would like me to re-texture before I begin any work. Failure to do so will cause the commission to be dropped entirely. If it is a model, make sure to check its TOS!
            18+: I own several NSFW avatars, if you would like me to do a commission for you on one of those- you must prove to me that you are over the age of 18. Failure to do so will cause the commission to be cancelled.
